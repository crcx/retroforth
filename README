RETRO is a modern, pragmatic Forth drawing influences from many
sources. It's clean, elegant, tiny, and easy to grasp and adapt
to various uses.

Features:

- Open Source (ISC License)
- Portable (runs on a MISC-style virtual machine)
- Small source & binaries
- Builds into a single, self contained binary for easy deployment
- Sources in literate format, using a Markdown variant

## Quick Start

For most systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, Linux):

    make

You will need a standard C compiler and `make`.

## Executables

Binaries will be placed in the `bin` directory.

The primary executable is `retro`. This is used for running the
examples and the Atua (gopher) & Casket (http) servers that
power forthworks.com.

The `retro` executable embeds the image into the binary, making
it trivial to copy and deploy.

This interface layer also extends the language with many new
words and vocabularies, adds scripting, file i/o, floating point,
and more.

The `retro` executable can handle a variety of command line
arguments which are covered in the manpage, but the most common
ones are:

    retro

Starts the *listener*, a basic REPL for interactive use.

    retro filename

This will run the code in the specified file, then exit. This
is also used to run programs as shell-type scripts using a
header line like `#!/usr/bin/env retro`.

    retro -i -f filename

This will run the code in the specified file, then start the
listener.

## Literate Sources

Source files for use with `retro` are written with code in
fenced blocks:

    commentary here

    ~~~
    code here
    ~~~

Anything outside the fenced blocks will be ignored.

## Documentation

The primary documentation is in RETRO-Book.md (and the formatted
epub.) Additional notes can be found in the `doc` directory.

## Alternative Implementations

In addition to the C and Python implementations, this source
tree includes additional implementations in C#, Nim, JavaScript,
and Pascal. These are not as well tested or as feature complete
as the main implementations, but are provided for your use if
the standard implementations will not suffice.
