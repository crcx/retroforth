    a personal, minimalistic forth

## Background

RETRO is a Forth dialect drawing influences from many sources. It uses
some, but not all of Chuck Moore's newer ideas. It's clean, elegant,
and tiny. It may not have many features, and it may not be particularly
useful by itself, but it's easy to grasp and easily adapted to various
uses.

This is the twelfth generation of the language and related programming
environment. It is a fresh start and is not compatible with the
previous generation.

## Quick Start

For FreeBSD, macOS, Linux:

    make
    cd bin && ./listener
