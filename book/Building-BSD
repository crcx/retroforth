# Building RETRO on BSD

RETRO is well supported on BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
systems. It should build on a base install of any of these
without issue.

## Requirements

- c compiler
- make

## Process

Run `make`.

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe
