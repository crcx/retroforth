# Obtaining RETRO

The RETRO source code can be obtained from http://forthworks.com/retro
or gopher://forthworks.com/1/retro

## Stable Releases

I periodically make stable releases. This will typically happen
two to four times per year. These are good for those needing a
solid base that doesn't change frequently.

## Snapshots

A lot of development happens between releases. I make snapshots
of my working source tree nightly (and often more often).

This is what I personally recommend for most users. It reflects
my latest system and is normally reliable as it's used daily in
production.

The latest snapshot can be downloaded from the following stable
URLs:

* http://forthworks.com/retro/r/latest.tar.gz
* gopher://forthworks.com/9/retro/r/latest.tar.gz

## Repository

I use a Fossil repository to manage development. To obtain a
copy of the repository install Fossil and:

```
fossil clone https://forthworks.com:8000 retro.fossil
mkdir retro
cd retro
fossil open /path/to/retro.fossil
```

See the Fossil documentation for details on using Fossil to
keep your local copy of the repository current.

This will let you stay current with my latest changes faster
than the snapshots, but you may occasionally encounter bigger
problems as some commits may be in a partially broken state.
