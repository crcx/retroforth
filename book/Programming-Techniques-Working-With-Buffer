# Working With a Buffer

RETRO provides words for operating on a linear memory area.
This can be useful in building strings or custom data
structures.

## Namespace

Words operating on the buffer are kept in the `buffer:`
namespace.

## Implementation

A buffer is a linear sequence of memory. The buffer words
provide a means of incrementally storing and retrieving
values from it.

The buffer words keep track of the start and end of the
buffer. They also ensure that an `ASCII:NULL` is written
after the last value, which make using them for string
data easy.

## Limitations

Only one buffer can be active at a time. RETRO provides a
`buffer:preserve` combinator to allow using a second one
before returning to the prior one.

## Set The Active Buffer

To set a buffer as the active one use `buffer:set`. This takes
an address.

The buffer will be assumed to be empty. The inital value will
be set to ASCII:NULL.

## Add Value

Use `buffer:add` to append a value to the buffer. This takes
a single value and will also add an ASCII:NULL after the end
of the buffer.

## Fetch Last Value

To return the last value in the buffer you can use `buffer:get`.
This removes the value and sets an ASCII:NULL in the memory
location the returned value occupied.

## Get Data About The Buffer

RETRO provides `buffer:start` to get the initial address in
the buffer, `buffer:end` to get the last address (ignoring the
ASCII:NULL), and `buffer:size` to return the number of values
in the buffer.

## Reset

You can reset a buffer to the empty state using `buffer:empty`.

## Example

To begin, create a memory region to use as a buffer.

```
'Test d:create #1025 allot
```

Then you can set this as the current buffer:

```
&Test buffer:set
```

When a buffer is set, the vocabulary sets an internal
index to the first address in it. This will be
incremented when you add data and decremented when you
remove data.

Let's add some stuff using `buffer:add`:

```
#100 buffer:add
#200 buffer:add
#300 buffer:add
```

And then retreive the values:

```
buffer:get n:put nl
buffer:get n:put nl
buffer:get n:put nl
```

You can remove all values using `buffer:empty`:

```
#100 buffer:add
#200 buffer:add
#300 buffer:add
buffer:empty
```

And ask the buffer how many items it contains:

```
buffer:size n:put nl
#100 buffer:add
#200 buffer:add
#300 buffer:add
buffer:size n:put nl
buffer:empty
```

The other functions are `buffer:start`, which returns
the address of the buffer, `buffer:end`, which returns
the address of the last value, and `buffer:preserve`.
The first is easy to demo:

```
buffer:start Test eq? n:put nl
```

The last one is useful. Only one buffer is ever active
at a given time. The `buffer:preserve` combinator lets
you execute a word, saving and restoring the current
buffer indexes. So the word could assign and use a new
buffer and this will reset the previous one after
control returns.

There are a few notes that need to be considered. The
preserve combinator saves the start and current index
but *not* the contents. If the word you call uses the
same buffer, the contents will remain altered.

Finally, the buffer words have one interesting trait:
they store an ASCII NULL after adding each item to the
buffer. This lets one use them to build strings easily.

```
Test buffer:set
$h buffer:add
$e buffer:add
$l buffer:add
$l buffer:add
$o buffer:add
$, buffer:add
#32 buffer:add
$w buffer:add
$o buffer:add
$r buffer:add
$l buffer:add
$d buffer:add
buffer:start s:put nl
```
