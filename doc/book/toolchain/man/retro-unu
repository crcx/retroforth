SYNOPSIS
     retro-unu filename

DESCRIPTION
     RETRO is a modern, pragmatic Forth drawing influences from many sources.
     It's clean, elegant, tiny, and easy to grasp and adapt to various uses.

     retro-unu is a tool for extracting code from fenced blocks in literate
     sources. It will write output to stdout.

     retro-unu does not support "out of order" structuring of code, commentary,
     and test blocks.
