# Starting RETRO

RETRO can be run for scripting or interactive use.

## Interactive

To start it interactively, run: `retro` without any command line
arguments, or with `-i`, `-s`, or `-i,c`.

Starting the interactive system:

```
retro
```

Or:

```
retro -i
```

This should be sufficient for most uses.

Starting the interactive system (without displaying the `Ok`
prompt or startup banner):

```
retro -s
```

RETRO also has a *character breaking* mode, in which input is
processed directly as entered, this is started with the `-c`
option:

```
retro -i,c
```

## Using In a Pipe

If using a Unix shell and piping input between processes, you
will probably want to use `-s` to supress the startup messages
and `Ok` prompt that normally appear.

E.g.,

```
echo "'lol s:put nl" | retro -s
```

## Running A Program In A File

You can run code in a file very easily. This is simply:

```
retro filename
```

You can follow the filename with any arguments that it may need.
These will be accessible to the program via the `sys:argc` and
`sys:argv` words.

Source files must be written in Unu format.

## Scripting

You can use RETRO to write scripts. Add a shebang:

```
#!/usr/bin/env retro
```

And make the file executable.

Source files must be written in Unu format.
