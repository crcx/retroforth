# Working With Assembly Language

RETRO runs on a virtual machine called Nga. It provides a
standard assembler for this called *Muri*.

Muri is a simple, multipass model that's not fancy, but
suffices for RETRO's needs.

## Assembling A Standalone File

A small example (*test.muri*)

    ~~~
    i liju....
    r main
    : c:put
    i liiire..
    i 0
    : main
    i lilica..
    d 97
    i liju....
    r main
    ~~~

Assembling it:

    retro-muri test.muri

So breaking down: Muri extracts the assembly code blocks to
assemble, then proceeds to do the assembly. Each source line
starts with a directive, followed by a space, and then ending
with a value.

The directives are:

    :    value is a label
    i    value is an instruction bundle
    d    value is a numeric value
    r    value is a reference
    s    value is a string to inline

Instructions for Nga are provided as bundles. Each memory
location can store up to four instructions. And each instruction
gets a two character identifier.

From the list of instructions:

    0 nop   5 push  10 ret   15 fetch 20 div   25 zret
    1 lit   6 pop   11 eq    16 store 21 and   26 halt
    2 dup   7 jump  12 neq   17 add   22 or    27 ienum
    3 drop  8 call  13 lt    18 sub   23 xor   28 iquery
    4 swap  9 ccall 14 gt    19 mul   24 shift 29 iinvoke

This reduces to:

    0 ..    5 pu    10 re    15 fe    20 di    25 zr
    1 li    6 po    11 eq    16 st    21 an    26 ha
    2 du    7 ju    12 ne    17 ad    22 or    27 ie
    3 dr    8 ca    13 lt    18 su    23 xo    28 iq
    4 sw    9 cc    14 gt    19 mu    24 sh    29 ii

Most are just the first two letters of the instruction name. I
use `..` instead of `no` for `NOP`, and the first letter of
each I/O instruction name. So a bundle may look like:

    dumure..

(This would correspond to `dup multiply return nop`).

## Runtime Assembler

RETRO also has a runtime variation of Muri that can be used
when you need to generate more optimal code. So one can write:

    :n:square dup * ;

Or:

    :n:square as{ 'dumure.. i }as ;

The second one will be faster, as the entire definition is one
bundle, which reduces memory reads and decoding by 2/3.

Doing this is less readable, so I only recommend doing so after
you have finalized working RETRO level code and determined the
best places to optimize.

The runtime assembler has the following directives:

    i    value is an instruction bundle
    d    value is a numeric value
    r    value is a reference

Additionally, in the runtime assembler, these are reversed:

    'dudumu.. i

Instead of:

    i dudumu..
