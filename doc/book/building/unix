# Building on BSD, Linux, macOS, and other Unix Targets

RETRO is well supported on BSD (tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD), Linux, and macOS systems. It should build on any
of these without issue.

## Requirements

- c compiler & linker
- standard headers
- make

## Process

For a standard 32-bit system:

Run `make`

For a 64-bit system:

Run `make OPTIONS=-DBIT64`

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe

## Platform Specific Notes

In addition to the 64-bit build, it is possible to override the
image size, address stack depth, and data stack depth by defining
the appropriate elements.

E.g., for a 64-bit build with:

    4,000,000 cells of memory
    4,000     item limit on data stack
    500       item limit on address stack

Run `make OPTIONS="-DBIT64 -DIMAGE_SIZE=4000000 -DSTACK_DEPTH=4000 -DADDRESSES=500"`


### Haiku

To build on Haiku, you need to link with the *network* library.
E.g.:

    make LDFLAGS=-lnetwork

### Unix

On Unix, you can optionally enable the sockets device (and thus the socket
words) by building with `-DENABLE_SOCKETS`.

    make OPTIONS="-DENABLE_SOCKETS"

## Issues

If you run into any build issues, please send details to
crc@forth.works so I can work on addressing them as quickly
as possible.
