# RETRO: a Modern, Pragmatic Forth

Welcome to RETRO, my personal take on the Forth language. This
is a modern system primarily targeting desktop, mobile, and
servers, though it can also be used on some larger (ARM, MIPS32)
embedded systems.

The language is Forth. It is untyped, uses a stack to pass data
between functions called words, and a dictionary which tracks
the word names and data structures.

But it's not a traditional Forth. RETRO draws influences from
many sources and takes a unique approach to the language.

RETRO has a large vocabulary of words. Keeping a copy of the
Glossary on hand is highly recommended as you learn to use RETRO.

This book will hopefully help you develop a better understanding
of RETRO and how it works.
