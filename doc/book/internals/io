# Internals: I/O

Retro provides three words for interacting with I/O. These are:

    io:enumerate    returns the number of attached devices
    io:query        returns information about a device
    io:invoke       invokes an interaction with a device

As an example, with an implementation providing an output source,
a block storage system, and keyboard:

    io:enumerate    will return `3` since there are three
                    i/o devices
    #0 io:query     will return 0 0, since the first device
                    is a screen (type 0) with a version of 0
    #1 io:query     will return 1 3, since the second device is
                    block storage (type 3), with a version of 1
    #2 io:query     will return 0 1, since the last device is a
                    keyboard (type 1), with a version of 0

In this case, some interactions can be defined:

    :c:put #0 io:invoke ;
    :c:get #2 io:invoke ;

Setup the stack, push the device ID, and then use `io:invoke`
to invoke the interaction.

A Retro system requires one I/O device (a generic output for a
single character). This must be the first device, and must have
a device ID of 0.

All other devices are optional and can be specified in any
order.
