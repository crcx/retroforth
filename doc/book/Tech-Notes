# Technical Notes and Reflections

This is a collection of short papers providing some additional
background and reflections on design decisions.

## Metacompilation and Assembly

RETRO 10 and 11 were written in themselves using a metacompiler.
I had been fascinated by this idea for a long time and was able
to explore it heavily. While I still find it to be a good idea,
the way I ended up doing it was problematic.

The biggest issue I faced was that I wanted to do this in one
step, where loading the RETRO source would create a new image
in place of the old one, switch to the new one, and then load
the higher level parts of the language over this. In retrospect,
this was a really bad idea.

My earlier design for RETRO was very flexible. I allowed almost
everything to be swapped out or extended at any time. This made
it extremely easy to customize the language and environment, but
made it crucial to keep track of what was in memory and what had
been patched so that the metacompiler wouldn't refer to anything
in the old image during the relocation and control change. It
was far too easy to make a mistake, discover that elements of
the new image were broken, and then have to go and revert many
changes to try to figure out what went wrong.

This was also complicated by the fact that I built new images
as I worked, and, while a new image could be built from the last
built one, it wasn't always possible to build a new image from
the prior release version. (Actually, it was often worse - I
failed to check in every change as I went, so often even the
prior commits couldn't rebuild the latest images).

For RETRO 12 I wanted to avoid this problem, so I decided to go
back to writing the kernel ("Rx") in assembly. I actually wrote
a Machine Forth dialect to generate the initial assembly, before
eventually hand tuning the final results to its current state.

I could (and likely will eventually) write the assembler in
RETRO, but the current one is in C, and is built as part of the
standard toolchain.

My VM actually has two assemblers. The older one is Naje. This
was intended to be fairly friendly to work with, and handles
many of the details of packing instructions for the user. Here
is an example of a small program in it:

    :square
      dup
      mul
      ret
    :main
      lit 35
      lit &square
      call
      lit &square
      call
      end

The other assembler is Muri. This is a far more minimalistic
assembler, but I've actually grown to prefer it. The above
example in Muri would become:

    i liju....
    r main
    : square
    i dumure..
    : main
    i lilica..
    d 35
    r square
    i en......

In Muri, each instruction is reduced to two characters, and the
bundlings are listed as part of an instruction bundle (lines
starting with `i`). This is less readable if you aren't very
familiar with Nga's assembly and packing rules, but allows a
very quick, efficient way of writing assembly for those who are.

I eventually rewrote the kernel in the Muri style as it's what
I prefer, and since there's not much need to make changes in it.

## The Path to Self Hosting

RETRO is an image based Forth system running on a lightweight
virtual machine. This is the story of how that image is made.

The first RETRO to use an image based approach was RETRO 10.
The earliest images were built using a compiler written in
Toka, an earlier experimental stack language I had written.
It didn't take long to want to drop the dependency on Toka,
so I rewrote the image compiler in RETRO and then began
development at a faster pace.

RETRO 11 was built using the last RETRO 10 image and an
evolved version of the metacompiler. This worked well, but
I eventually found it to be problematic.

One of the issues I faced was the inability to make a new
image from the prior stable release. Since I develop and
test changes incrementally, I reached a point where the
current metacompiler and image required each other. This
wasn't a fatal flaw, but it was annoying.

Perhaps more critical was the fragility of the system. In
R11 small mistakes could result in a corrupt image. The test
suite helped identify some of these, but there were a few
times I was forced to dig back through the version control
history to recover a working image.

The fragile nature was amplified by some design decisions.
In R11, after the initial kernel was built, it would be
moved to memory address 0, then control would jump into the
new kernel to finish building the higher level parts.

Handling this was a tricky task. In R11 almost everything
could be revectored, so the metacompiler had to ensure that
it didn't rely on anything in the old image during the move.
This caused a large number of issues over R11's life.

So on to RETRO 12. I decided that this would be different.
First, the kernel would be assembly, with an external tool
to generate the core image. The kernel is in `Rx.md` and the
assembler is `Muri`. To load the standard library, I wrote a
second tool, `retro-extend`. This separation has allowed me
many fewer headaches as I can make changes more easily and
rebuild from scratch when necessary.

But I miss self-hosting. So last fall I decided to resolve
this. And today I'm pleased to say that it is now done.

There are a few parts to this.

**Unu**. I use a Markdown variation with fenced code blocks.
The tool I wrote in C to extract these is called `unu`. For
a self hosting RETRO, I rewrote this as a combinator that
reads in a file and runs another word against each line in the
file. So I could display the code block contents by doing:

    'filename [ s:put nl ] unu

This made it easier to implement the other tools.

**Muri**. This is my assembler. It's minimalistic, fast, and
works really well for my purposes. RETRO includes a runtime
version of this (using `as{`, `}as`, `i`, `d`, and `r`), so
all I needed for this was to write a few words to parse the
lines and run the corresponding runtime words. As with the C
version, this is a two pass assembler.

Muri generates a new `ngaImage` with the kernel. To create a
full image I needed a way to load in the standard library and
I/O extensions.

This is handled by **retro-extend**. This is where it gets
more complex. I implemented the Nga virtual machine in RETRO
to allow this to run the new image in isolation from the
host image. The new ngaImage is loaded, the interpreter is
located, and each token is passed to the interpreter. Once
done, the new image is written to disk.

So at this point I'm pleased to say that I can now develop
RETRO using only an existing copy of RETRO (VM+image) and
tools (unu, muri, retro-extend, and a line oriented text
editor) written in RETRO.

This project has delivered some additional side benefits.
During the testing I was able to use it to identify a few
bugs in the I/O extensions, and the Nga-in-RETRO will replace
the older attempt at this in the debugger, allowing a safer
testing environment.

What issues remain?

The extend process is *slow*. On my main development server
(Linode 1024, OpenBSD 6.4, 64-bit) it takes a bit over five
minutes to complete loading the standard library, and a few
additional depending on the I/O drivers selected.

Most of the performance issues come from running Nga-in-RETRO
to isolate the new image from the host one. It'd be possible
to do something a bit more clever (e.g., running a RETRO
instance using the new image via a subprocess and piping in
the source, or doing relocations of the data), but this is
less error prone and will work on all systems that I plan to
support (including, with a few minor adjustments, the native
hardware versions [assuming the existance of mass storage]).

## Prefixes as a Language Element

A big change in RETRO 12 was the elimination of the traditional
parser from the language. This was a sacrifice due to the lack
of an I/O model. RETRO has no way to know *how* input is given
to the `interpret` word, or whether anything else will ever be
passed into it.

And so `interpret` operates only on the current token. The core
language does not track what came before or attempt to guess at
what might come in the future.

This leads into the prefixes. RETRO 11 had a complicated system
for prefixes, with different types of prefixes for words that
parsed ahead (e.g., strings) and words that operated on the
current token (e.g., `@`). RETRO 12 eliminates all of these in
favor of just having a single prefix model.

The first thing `interpret` does is look to see if the first
character in a token matches a `prefix:` word. If it does, it
passes the rest of the token as a string pointer to the prefix
specific handler to deal with. If there is no valid prefix
found, it tries to find it in the dictionary. Assuming that it
finds the words, it passes the `d:xt` field to the handler that
`d:class` points to. Otherwise it calls `err:notfound`.

This has an important implication: *words can not reliably
have names that start with a prefix character.*

It also simplifies things. Anything that would normally parse
becomes a prefix handler. So creating a new word? Use the `:`
prefix. Strings? Use `'`. Pointers? Try `&`. And so on. E.g.,

    In ANS                  | In RETRO
    : foo ... ;             | :foo ... ;
    ' foo                   | &foo
    : bar ... ['] foo ;     | :bar ... &foo ;
    s" hello world!"        | 'hello_world!

If you are familiar with ColorForth, prefixes are a similar
idea to colors, but can be defined by the user as normal words.

After doing this for quite a while I rather like it. I can see
why Chuck Moore eventually went towards ColorForth as using
color (or prefixes in my case) does simplify the implementation
in many ways.

## On The Kernel Wordset

In implementing the RETRO 12 kernel (called Rx) I had to decide
on what functionality would be needed. It was important to me
that this be kept clean and minimalistic, as I didn't want to
spend a lot of time changing it as time progressed. It's far
nicer to code at the higher level, where the RETRO language is
functional, as opposed to writing more assembly code.

So what made it in?

Primitives

These are words that map directly to Nga instructions.

    dup      drop     swap   call   eq?   -eq?   lt?   gt?
    fetch    store    +      -      *     /mod   and   or
    xor      shift    push   pop    0;

Memory

    fetch-next    store-next    ,    s,

Strings

    s:to-number    s:eq?    s:length

Flow Control

    choose    if    -if    repeat    again

Compiler & Interpreter

    Compiler    Heap        ;       [    ]      Dictionary
    d:link      d:class     d:xt    d:name      d:add-header
    class:word  class:primitive     class:data  class:macro
    prefix::    prefix:#    prefix:&    prefix:$
    interpret   d:lookup    err:notfound

I *could* slightly reduce this. The $ prefix could be defined in
higher level code, and I don't strictly *need* to expose the
`fetch-next` and `store-next` here. But since the are already
implemented as dependencies of the words in the kernel, it would
be a bit wasteful to redefine them later in higher level code.

With these words the rest of the language can be built up. Note
that the Rx kernel does not provide any I/O words. It's assumed
that the RETRO interfaces will add these as best suited for the
systems they run on.

There is another small bit. All images start with a few key
pointers in fixed offsets of memory. These are:

    | Offset | Contains                    |
    | ------ | --------------------------- |
    | 0      | lit call nop nop            |
    | 1      | Pointer to main entry point |
    | 2      | Dictionary                  |
    | 3      | Heap                        |
    | 4      | RETRO version identifier    |

An interface can use the dictionary pointer and knowledge of the
dictionary format for a specific RETRO version to identify the
location of essential words like `interpret` and `err:notfound`
when implementing the user facing interface.

## On The Evolution Of Ngaro Into Nga

When I decided to begin work on what became RETRO 12, I knew
the process would involve updating Ngaro, the virtual machine
that RETRO 10 and 11 ran on.

Ngaro rose out of an earlier experimental virtual machine I had
written back in 2005-2006. This earlier VM, called Maunga, was
very close to what Ngaro ended up being, though it had a very
different approach to I/O. (All I/O in Maunga was intended to be
memory mapped; Ngaro adopted a port based I/O system).

Ngaro itself evolved along with RETRO, gaining features like
automated skipping of NOPs and a LOOP opcode to help improve
performance. But the I/O model proved to be a problem. When I
created Ngaro, I had the idea that I would always be able to
assume a console/terminal style environment. The assumption was
that all code would be entered via the keyboard (or maybe a
block editor), and that proved to be the fundamental flaw as
time went on.

As RETRO grew it was evident that the model had some serious
problems. Need to load code from a file? The VM and language had
functionality to pretend it was being typed in. Want to run on
something like a browser, Android, or iOS? The VM would need to
be implemented in a way that simulates input being typed into
the VM via a simulated keyboard. And RETRO was built around this.
I couldn't change it because of a promise to maintain, as much
as possible, source compatibility for a period of at least five
years.

When the time came to fix this, I decided at the start to keep
the I/O model separate from the core VM. I also decided that the
core RETRO language would provide some means of interpreting
code without requiring an assumption that a traditional terminal
was being used.

So Nga began. I took the opportunity to simplify the instruction
set to just 26 essential instructions, add support for packing
multiple instructions per memory location (allowing a long due
reduction in memory footprint), and to generally just make a far
simpler design.

I've been pleased with Nga. On its own it really isn't useful
though. So with RETRO I embed it into a larger framework that
adds some basic I/O functionality. The *interfaces* handle the
details of passing tokens into the language and capturing any
output. They are free to do this in whatever model makes most
sense on a given platform.

So far I've implemented:

    - a scripting interface, reading input from a file and
      offering file i/o, gopher, and reading from stdin, and
      sending output to stdout.
    - an interactive interface, built around ncurses, reading
      input from stdin, and displaying output to a scrolling
      buffer.
    - an iOS interface, built around a text editor, directing
      output to a separate interface pane.
    - an interactive block editor, using a gopher-based block
      data store. Output is displayed to stdout, and input is
      done via the blocks being evaluated or by reading from
      stdin.

In all cases, the only common I/O word that has to map to an
exposed instruction is `putc`, to display a single character to
some output device. There is no requirement for a traditional
keyboard input model.

By doing this I was able to solve the biggest portability issue
with the RETRO 10/11 model, and make a much simpler, cleaner
language in the end.

## RETRO 11 (2011 - 2019): A Look Back

So it's now been about five years since the last release of RETRO
11. While I still see some people obtaining and using it, I've
moved on to the twelth generation of RETRO. It's time for me to
finally retire RETRO 11.

As I prepare to do so, I thought I'd take a brief look back.

RETRO 11 began life in 2011. It grew out of RETRO 10, which was
the first version of RETRO to not be written in x86 assembly
language. For R10 and R11, I wrote a portable virtual machine
(with numerous implementations) and the Forth dialect was kept
in an image file which ran on the VM.

RETRO 10 worked, but was always a bit too sloppy and changed
drastically between releases. The major goal of RETRO 11 was to
provide a stable base for a five year period. In retrospect,
this was mostly achieved. Code from earlier releases normally
needed only minor adjustments to run on later releases, though
newer releases added significantly to the language.

There were seven releases.

- Release 11.0: 2011, July
- Release 11.1: 2011, November
- Release 11.2: 2012, January
- Release 11.3: 2012, March
- Release 11.4: 2012, July
- Release 11.5: 2013, March
- Release 11.6: 2014, August

Development was fast until 11.4. This was the point at which I
had to slow down due to RSI problems. It was also the point
which I started experiencing some problems with the metacompiler
(as discussed previously).

RETRO 11 was flexible. All colon definitions were setup as hooks,
allowing new functionality to be layered in easily. This allowed
the later releases to add things like vocabularies, search order,
tab completion, and keyboard remapping. This all came at a cost
though: later things could use the hooks to alter behavior of
existing words, so it was necessary to use a lot of caution to
ensure that the layers didn't break the earlier code.

The biggest issue was the I/O model. RETRO 11 and the Ngaro VM
assumed the existence of a console environment. All input was
required to be input at the keyboard, and all output was to be
shown on screen. This caused some problems. Including code from
a file required some tricks, temporarily rewriting the keyboard
input function to read from the file. It also became a major
issue when I wrote the iOS version. The need to simulate the
keyboard and console complicated everything and I had to spend
a considerable amount of effort to deal with battery performance
resulting from the I/O polling and wait states.

But on the whole it worked well. I used RETRO 11.6 until I started
work on RETRO 12 in late 2016, and continued running some tools
written in R11 until the first quarter of last year.

The final image file was 23,137 cells (92,548 bytes). This was
bloated by keeping some documentation (stack comments and short
descriptions) in the image, which started in 11.4. This contained
269 words.

I used RETRO 11 for a wide variety of tasks. A small selection of
things that were written includes:

- a pastebin
- front end to ii (irc client)
- small explorations of interactive fiction
- irc log viewer
- tool to create html from templates
- tool to automate creation of an SVCD from a set of photos
- tools to generate reports from data sets for my employer

In the end, I'm happy with how RETRO 11 turned out. I made some
mistakes in embracing too much complexity, but despite this it
was a successful system for many years.
