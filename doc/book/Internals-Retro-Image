# Internals: The Retro Image

The actual RETRO language is stored as a memory image for Nga.

## Format

The image file is a flat, linear sequence of signed 32-bit
values. Each value is stored in little endian format. The
size is not fixed. An interface should check when loading to
ensure that the physical image is not larger than the emulated
memory.

## Header

The image will start with two cells. The first is a liju....
instruction, the second is the target address for the jump.
This serves to skip over the rest of the data and reach the
actual entry point.

This is followed by a pointer to the most recent dictionary
header, a pointer to the next free address in memory, and
then the RETRO version number.

    | Offset | Contains                    |
    | ------ | --------------------------- |
    | 0      | lit call nop nop            |
    | 1      | Pointer to main entry point |
    | 2      | Dictionary                  |
    | 3      | Heap                        |
    | 4      | RETRO version               |

The actual code starts after this header.

The version number is the year and month. As an example,
the 12.2019.6 release will have a version number of
`201906`.

## Layout

Assuming an Nga built with 524287 cells of memory:

    | RANGE           | CONTAINS                     |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | 0 - 1024        | rx kernel                    |
    | 1025 - 1535     | token input buffer           |
    | 1536 +          | start of heap space          |
    | ............... | free memory for your use     |
    | 506879          | buffer for string evaluate   |
    | 507904          | temporary strings (32 * 512) |
    | 524287          | end of memory                |

The buffers at the end of memory will resize when specific
variables related to them are altered.
